A tech stack refers to a set of tools, programming languages, and technologies that work 
together to build digital products or solutions such as websites, mobile, and web apps.
A tech stack consists of two equally important elements: the frontend (client-side) and
backend (server-side). Both work together to create a working tech stack. This is also
referred to as an application stack.
